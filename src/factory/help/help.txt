Commands
show [inventory, people, items, details, ...]   f.e. "show people"
look [in, under, above, ....] [name of detail]  f.e. "look in small box"
go to [name of exit]                            f.e. "go to Corridor"
talk to [name of person]                        f.e. "talk to parsen"
pick up [name of item]                          f.e. "pick up wine"
use [name of item in inventory]                 f.e. "use wine" (to drink) or "use stick" (to equipe)

All command igonore case. In addition partial matching words. So instead of writing "pick up pack of cigaretts" you may enter "pick up cigaretts" or even "pick up cig". This only works for people, exits, items etc. not for commands. So "show invent" does not work, "show inventory" is neccesarry.
