  description: You are standing in an enormous foyer of what seems to be a hospital. You can hear every small sound echoing between the tall walls. The foyer is mainly empty apart from a small box standing in one corner. Opposite of the entrance door a huge statue of a man holding his head in agony looks down on you. Left and right from the statue, stairs lead up further intro the hospital.
